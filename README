ChintzyCMS

===

Chintzy is a content management system focused on caching first and asking
questions later. By default, it is intended to not touch your Postgres database
at all; it will aggressively try to serve cached HTML content.

This currently powers the EdgeLink Consulting (edgelinkconsulting.com) website
as well as a few private installations. I'm still working on getting things
ready for Github/public viewing, but figured it would be a good idea to
have a central repo that won't change places when I nuke out a VM.


== Installation ==
* Create pgsql database and change settings in db.inc.php. Run the
  following command sequence as root, replacing /var/www with your 
  desired installation path:
  
  # su - postgres
  $ sh /var/www/includes/scripts/create_db.sh dbname dbuser dbpass

* Import schema from schema.pgsql
    
  $ sh /var/www/includes/scripts/create_schema.sh dbname

* Create root user with your required password.
  To generate the password, run sha256(username + password + salt)
  where salt is defined in salt.inc.php. By default, this is blank,
  but you really should set this before doing anything with your site.
  
  $ sh /var/www/includes/scripts/create_root_user.sh dbname username password
        
* Create home/top parent page:

  $ sh /var/www/includes/scripts/create_home_page.sh dbname
    
* Log into the administration panel with your root credentials at http://example.com/admin/ 
    
== Store Module ==
* The store module is not available in public format at this time. 
  Essentially, it's a chintzy e-commerce system that lets you operate
  an online store. There are a whole bunch of modules that will be
  published at some point in the future.
  
* For the store module, allow 'authenticated user' permissions to view cart, checkout, etc...
    
        == anonymous user ==
        * view store
    
        == authenticated user ==
        * view store
        * view cart
        * checkout cart
