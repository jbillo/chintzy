ChintzyCMS

===

Chintzy is a content management system focused on caching first and asking
questions later. By default, it is intended to not touch your Postgres database
at all; it will aggressively try to serve cached HTML content.

This currently powers the EdgeLink Consulting (edgelinkconsulting.com) website
as well as a few private installations. I'm still working on getting things
ready for Github/public viewing, but figured it would be a good idea to
have a central repo that won't change places when I nuke out a VM.
